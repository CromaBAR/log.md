# #100DaysofMLCode
I'm going to use this space to save the details of my personal #100DaysofMLCode.

# Day 0:
Today's progress: I already knew that Tensorflow was a module for Python that ables us to program codes for machine learning. But today I have understood a machine learning program made entirely with python and numpy. This is a very useful starting.

Thoughts: It's really exciting imagining how i can improve.
